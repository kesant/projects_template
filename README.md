# Template for Machine learning projects

_A logical, reasonably standardized, but flexible project structure for doing and sharing data science work._

## Requirements

- [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/download.html)
- [Cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html): This can be installed with pip by or conda depending on how you manage your Python packages:

## Installing Miniconda
### Windows

These three commands quickly and quietly download the latest 64-bit Windows installer, rename it to a shorter file name, silently install, and then delete the installer:

``` bash
curl https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe -o miniconda.exe
start /wait "" .\miniconda.exe /S
del miniconda.exe
```
After installing, open the Anaconda Prompt (miniconda3) program to use Miniconda3.

### Linux

These four commands download the latest 64-bit version of the Linux installer, rename it to a shorter file name, silently install, and then delete the installer:

``` bash
mkdir -p ~/miniconda3
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3
rm ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
```
After installing, add the following line to your .bashrc to initialize conda automatically:

``` bash
export PATH=~/miniconda3/bin:$PATH
```
Then run:
``` bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now you can use Miniconda3 on your Linux system.

## Installing Cookiecutter

``` bash
pip install cookiecutter
```

or

``` bash
conda install -c conda-forge cookiecutter
```

## Create a new project

In a folder where you want your project generated:

```bash
cookiecutter https://gitlab.easymetering.com/artificial-intelligence/template_ia
```
